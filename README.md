## ⚽ Transfer Market: Data Visualization of Football Transfers (2013-2023)

### 📌 Project Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of football transfer activities in the top 5 European leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A, Ligue 1) over the last decade (2013-2023). The goal is to explore transfer fees, player valuations, spending patterns, and market trends through data visualization techniques.

The analysis focuses on:

Strategic decisions by major clubs, including high-profile transfers, loan deals, and free transfers.
Factors influencing player transfers (age, position, performance, market demand).
Relationship between transfer spending and team performance on the field.
League-wise transfer trends, identifying clubs with the highest spending and the impact of financial investments.

### 📂 Data Source
The dataset for this project is sourced from [**Transfermarkt**](https://www.transfermarkt.com/), a well-known platform that provides football-related data, including player transfers, market values, and club information.

For this project, I have merged the data for all years (2013-2023) into a single dataset for simplicity. Historical data for all years up to 1942 can be found [**here**](https://www.transfermarkt.com/).

### 🔍 Key Objectives
✔ Analyze spending trends in different leagues over the last decade.


✔ Visualize top transfer fees, spending distributions, and transfer patterns.

✔ Identify clubs with the highest investments and their financial strategies.

✔ Examine player attributes (age, position, market value) affecting transfer fees.

✔ Investigate the correlation between spending and on-field success.

### 📊 Data & Methodology

Dataset Features: Player name, age, nationality, position, club, market value, transfer fee, transfer window, league, season, and more.

Data Preprocessing:

Cleaned missing values and handled outliers.

Merged datasets from multiple leagues into a single dataset.

Converted categorical columns and formatted numerical values for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed spending trends, positional transfers, and league-wise transactions.

Identified record-breaking transfers and financial trajectories.

Visualized spending patterns by club and player movement over time.

### 📌 Visualizations Included

📊 Bar Charts: Transfer spending per league, club-wise spending trends.

📈 Line Plots: Transfer activity over seasons, spending patterns.

📍 Choropleth Maps: Global distribution of player transfers.

📂 Treemaps: Top dealing clubs and spending distribution.

🌀 Sunburst Charts: Top transfer fees by league, club, and player.

📡 Radar Charts: Positional spending patterns.

🔄 Interactive Dashboards: Transfer fee analysis by season, league, and position.

###🚀 Technologies Used

Python 🐍: Data preprocessing & analysis (Pandas, NumPy)

Data Visualization 📊: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Dash

Jupyter Notebook 💻: Interactive data exploration

### 📢 Insights & Findings

The Premier League dominates transfer spending, surpassing all other leagues.

Top clubs like Barcelona, Manchester City, Chelsea, and PSG have spent the most on high-profile transfers.

Attacking players command the highest transfer fees, followed by midfielders and defenders.

Age plays a key role—peak transfer fees occur for players aged 22-25, but exceptions exist for world-class veterans.

Money spent does not always equal success—some high-spending clubs failed to win major titles.

### 📌 Future Work

🔹 Enhance interactive dashboards to explore transfer trends dynamically.

🔹 Apply machine learning models to predict future transfer fees.

🔹 Expand analysis to include club revenue, sponsorship deals, and financial fair play (FFP) regulations.
